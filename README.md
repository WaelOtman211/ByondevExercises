In each file, there's a different coding exercise that deals with various types of data structures like arrays, sorting, graphs, and trees. I've included a main function in each file along with example inputs so you can pull to your IDEA and run the program.
For Question 11, I initially tried different algorithms to solve the problem. Eventually, I settled on using Dijkstra's algorithm because it offered the best balance between time and memory efficiency. The goal for each question was to provide a solution that works well and doesn't use more computer resources than necessary.
I focused on making the code efficient and effective, keeping it simple and easy to understand.
It's common to name files based on the exercise they contain or simply by numbering them according to the question.
